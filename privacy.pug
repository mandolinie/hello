      h4 Cookies
      h5 a) Session cookies
      p We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address.
      p This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.
      p The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.
      p If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
      p When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.

      h5 c) Disabling cookies
      p You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.
      p If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.

      p The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
      p Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.

      h4 General introduction
      p General linking to third-party profiles: The provider includes links to social media website.
      p The legal basis for this is Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The legitimate interest of the provider is to improve the quality of use of the website.
      p After the customer has been forwarded, information about the user is recorded by the respective social media. This is initially data such as IP address, date, time, and page visited. If the user is logged into his/her user account of the respective social media at the same time, the social media operator can, if required, assign the information collected from the user’s specific visit to the user’s personal account. If the user interacts via a “Share” button of the respective social media, this information can be stored in the user’s personal user account and, if required, be published. If the user wants to prevent the collected information from being directly assigned to his/her user account, the user must log out before clicking on the graphic. It is also possible to configure the respective user account accordingly.

      h4 Google Analytics
      p We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).
      p The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.
      p Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is transmitted to the US.
      p The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and of the internet in general.
      p Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides further information with regard to its data protection practices at <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners</a>, including options you can exercise to prevent such use of your data.
      p In addition, Google offers an opt-out add-on at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a> in addition to further information. This add-on can be installed on the most popular browsers and offers you further control over the data that Google collects when you visit our website. The add-on informs Google Analytics‘ JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services we may use as detailed herein.
